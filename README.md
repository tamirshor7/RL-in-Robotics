AI and Robotics Final Assignment - RL solution.
Using PPO (from 'https://github.com/nikhilbarhate99/PPO-PyTorch.git') to optimize optimal policy for turtlebot3 opting in environment containing collectable objects and a set of workstations. In each workstation there are is a set of legal actions to perform. The robot is given a set of sequneces of tasks to perform and a time constraint. Each completion results in known reward.
